# rapidlyExploringRandomTrees
Exploration of RRT algorithms. To run this program:
1. In the command prompt, go to the directory where RRT.py is located.
2. Type "python rrt.py workspace.txt 1.0 1.0 9.0 9.0 display" to run RRT.py with start at point (1.0, 1.0) and goal at point (9.0, 9.0).

RRT.py also accepts different run parameters:
1. To run RRT.py with different polygons, edit "workspace.txt" with different polygon point values.
2. To run RRT.py with different start and goal positions, replace "1.0 1.0 9.0 9.0" with the x1, x2, y1, and y2 values of your choosing.
3. To run RRT.py without display, omit "display" at the end of the command.
